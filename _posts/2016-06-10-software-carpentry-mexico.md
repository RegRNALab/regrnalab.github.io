We recently concluded the first [Software
Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/)
Workshop in Mexico! This has been a pet dream of mine for a while as I find their teaching methods very effective for newcomers to programming and bioinformatics. This is generally the case of researchers with a strong biology background that want to undertake their own genomic analyses. 

The course was kindly sponsored by the [Software
Carpentry Foundation](http://software-carpentry.org/) and
the [National Laboratory for the Genomics of Biodiversity
(LANGEBIO, Cinvestav)](http://software-carpentry.org/). It was taught jointly with the Executive Director
of the Software Carpentry Foundation Jonah Duckles and
myself.  

We had a fantastic turnout, receiving 32 students from a
number of Mexican academic institutions including the
[Instituto de Biotecnologia, UNAM](http://www.ibt.unam.mx/), 
[Colegio de Postgraduados](http://www.colpos.mx/wb/),
[Universidad de Guanajuato](), 
[Instituto Tecnologico Superior de Irapuato](http://www.itesi.edu.mx/), 
[Cinvestav Zacatenco](http://www.cinvestav.mx/), 
[Cinvestav Irapuato](http://www.ira.cinvestav.mx/) and 
[LANGEBIO](http://www.langebio.cinvestav.mx/).  

Over the course of two days (June 8th and 9th) we taugh the basics of the Unix shell, Git and programming in R through live coding exercises. 

Here are some tweets of the event:

We were also pleased to find that, according to the polls
after the workshop we have a [net promoter
score](https://www.netpromoter.com/know/) of 71!

Here is some of the feedback we received:

> "The instructors were really easy going and it was really
fun to learn new computational skills."

> "The exercises all work and there are lots support for
people if they are stuck."

Thanks to all the students, helpers, instructors and institutions that made this event a success.
