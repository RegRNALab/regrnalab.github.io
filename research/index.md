The recent advent of high-throughput or \"next generation\" sequencing (NGS) of nucleic
acids has unveiled a plethora of novel regulatory molecules, in particular
non-coding RNAs - RNA molecules that presumably do not encode proteins. Even though
some RNAs have long been known to have gene regulatory and catalytic capabilities,
only in recent years has the sheer scale of regulatory capabilities of non-coding
RNAs been truly envisioned. 

We use bioinformatic and genomic data analysis tools to
understand the evolution of gene regulatory mechanisms
underlying the phenotypic diversity and cell
differentiation in multicellular eukaryotes. 

We have a special interest in the evolutionary dynamics of non coding RNA
molecules. To better understand their changes across time
we study a number of biological models that span different evolutionary scales,
including many mexican species of plants and animals.
