The recent advent of high-throughput or \"next generation\" sequencing (NGS) of nucleic
acids has unveiled a plethora of novel regulatory molecules, in particular
non-coding RNAs - RNA molecules that presumably do not encode proteins. Even though
some RNAs have long been known to have gene regulatory and catalytic capabilities,
only in recent years has the sheer scale of regulatory capabilities of non-coding
RNAs been truly envisioned. 

In our lab we use bioinformatic and genomic data analysis tools to understand the evolution of gene regulatory mechanisms underlying the phenotypic diversity and cell differentiation in multicellular eukaryotes. 

To do this we use a number of models that span different evolutionary scales,
including many important mexican endemic species.
