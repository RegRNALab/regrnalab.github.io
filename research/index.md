We are a group using bioinformatic and genomic data analyis tools to understand the evolution of gene regulatory mechanisms underlying the phenotypic diversity and cell differentiation in multicellular eukaryotes. We are particularly interested in the regulatory roles of non-coding RNAs in these processes.
