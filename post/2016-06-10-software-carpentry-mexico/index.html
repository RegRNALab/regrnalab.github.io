        <p>We recently concluded the first <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/">Software
Carpentry</a>
Workshop in Mexico! This has been a pet dream of mine for a while as I find their teaching methods very effective for newcomers to programming and bioinformatics. This is generally the case of researchers with a strong biology background that want to undertake their own genomic analyses.</p>
<p>The course was kindly sponsored by the <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/">Software
Carpentry Foundation</a> and
the <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/">National Laboratory for the Genomics of Biodiversity
(LANGEBIO, Cinvestav)</a>. It was taught jointly with the Executive Director
of the Software Carpentry Foundation Jonah Duckles and
myself.</p>
<p>We had a fantastic turnout, receiving 32 students from a
number of Mexican academic institutions including the
<a href="http://www.ibt.unam.mx/">Instituto de Biotecnologia, UNAM</a>,
<a href="http://www.colpos.mx/wb/">Colegio de Postgraduados</a>,
<a href="">Universidad de Guanajuato</a>,
<a href="http://www.itesi.edu.mx/">Instituto Tecnologico Superior de Irapuato</a>,
<a href="http://www.cinvestav.mx/">Cinvestav Zacatenco</a>,
<a href="http://www.ira.cinvestav.mx/">Cinvestav Irapuato</a> and
<a href="http://www.langebio.cinvestav.mx/">LANGEBIO</a>.</p>
<p>Over the course of two days (June 8th and 9th) we taugh the basics of the Unix shell, Git and programming in R through live coding exercises.</p>
<p>Here are some tweets of the event:</p>

<p>We were also pleased to find that, according to the polls
after the workshop we have a <a href="https://www.netpromoter.com/know/">net promoter
score</a> of 71!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here is some of the feedback we received:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The instructors were really easy going and it was really
fun to learn new computational skills.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The exercises all work and there are lots support for
people if they are stuck.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can find more details about the
workshop

<p>Thanks to all the students, helpers, instructors and institutions that made this event a success.</p>
