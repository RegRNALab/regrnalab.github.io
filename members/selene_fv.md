Selene Fernandez is a bioinformatician working on the evolution of gene
regulatory mechanisms underlying the phenotypic diversity and cell differentiation
in multicellular eukaryotes. She is particularly interested in the regulatory roles of
non-coding RNAs in these processes. 

Selene has a Bachelor in Genomic Sciences from the
National Autonomous University of Mexico
([LCG-UNAM](http://www.lcg.unam.mx/)). She has
a Ph.D. in Bioinformatics from the Institute for
Molecular Biosciences ([IMB](http://www.imb.uq.edu.au/)) at
the [University of Queensland](http://uq.edu.au/),
Australia, with postdoctoral training at the [School of
Biological Sciences](http://biology.uq.edu.au/) at the same university. 

In addition to her academic roles, Selene actively participates in initiatives that link scientists
and the general public (such as [Mas Ciencia por Mexico](http://masciencia.org/), 
[Clubes de Ciencia Mexico](http://www.clubesdeciencia.mx/)),
programs to introduce researchers to computing
([Software](http://software-carpentry.org/)/[Data
Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/)) as well as
mentoring programs ([Ekpapalek](http://www.ekpapalek.com/)).
