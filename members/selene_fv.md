Australia, with postdoctoral training at the [School of
Biological Sciences](http://biology.uq.edu.au/) at the same university. 

In addition to her academic roles, Selene actively participates in initiatives that link scientists
and the general public (such as [Mas Ciencia por Mexico](http://masciencia.org/), 
[Clubes de Ciencia Mexico](http://www.clubesdeciencia.mx/)),
programs to introduce researchers to computing
([Software](http://software-carpentry.org/)/[Data
Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/)) as well as
mentoring programs ([Ekpapalek](http://www.ekpapalek.com/) and [Mujeres en STEM: Futuras LÃ­deres](https://www.usmexicofound.org/programs/mujeres-en-stem)). 

She was one of five recipients of the L'Oreal-UNESCO research fellowship [For Women in Science](http://fondationloreal.com/en) - Mexico chapter - in the year 2016.
